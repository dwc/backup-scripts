This is a basic set of helper functions for creating backups of your
filesystems, Subversion repositories, and MySQL and PostgreSQL
databases.

I configure backups to run from cron using the following entry in my
crontab:

  test -d $HOME/backup-scripts/daily/$(hostname) \
    && run-parts --verbose $HOME/backup-scripts/daily/$(hostname)

Each directory contains one or more shell scripts corresponding to the
backups tasks for the host, as determined using the `hostname'
command.

See the `example.sh' file in the `daily' or `manual' directory for
pointers.
