This is a basic set of helper functions for creating backups of your
filesystems, Subversion repositories, and MySQL and PostgreSQL
databases.

I configure backups to run from cron using the following entry in my
crontab:

  test -d $HOME/backup-scripts/daily && run-parts --verbose $HOME/backup-scripts/daily

In this case, the `daily' directory contains one or more shell scripts
corresponding to the backup tasks.

See the `example.sh' file in the `daily' or `manual' directory for
pointers.
